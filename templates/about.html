			<h2>Who I am</h2>
			<p>Hi there! My name is Justin Ruloff. I'm a junior at the University of Michigan Ann arbor. I'm 21 years old, and I hail from Brownstown, Michigan. This is my portfolio for a class I'm taking, SI 206 - Agile Web Development. I hope you enjoy, and please feel free to <a href="contact.html" alt="contact link">contact me</a> if you have any concerns. You will receive an automated e-mail and I will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

			<h2>My family</h2>
			<p>I am a family man, tried and true. I have a brother, two step brothers, and a step sister. I love hanging out with my siblings, and our family loves to take vacations. My dad is my idol; he has taught me how to be a gentleman, a competitor, and a friend. Without my family, I would not be who I am today. They have provided me with a fantastic childhood, exposing me to opportunities that I am forever grateful for.</p>

			<h2>Go Blue</h2>
			<p>I am your typical "obsessed with Michigan football" student. I was born and bred a Wolverine, and my dad wouldn't have it any other way. I bleed Maize and Blue, and when we lose, my heart hurts. (Don't even think about asking me how I felt after the State game). This year is going to be the year we win it all. Harbaugh 2016. Put me on the team, coach, I've got a cannon of a leg (I can make a 40-yard field goal, and I don't fumble punts...)</p>

		<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3 aboutParagraph">
			<h2>Athletics</h2>
			<p>I am the most sports-crazy person you'll ever meet. I'm naturally athletic in the sense that I can pick up any sport fairly quickly. My main sport is basketball; I was the only kid in my high school who could dunk (sort of bragging, a little). I won the league championship for High Jump my junior year of high school, and made it to the state meet for Long Jump my senior year. I also enjoy golfing (and getting very, very angry while playing), volleyball, and flag football.</p>

			<h2>New York</h2>
			<p>I took a trip to New York this summer, and ended up on a rooftop bar with a backdrop including the Empire State Building.</p>

			<h2>Las Vegas</h2>
			<p>I departed for Vegas in January. I didn't lose any money, so it was a successful trip. I'm also going in September, so hopefully I can hit it big at craps!</p>

			<h2>Minneapolis</h2>
			<p>My friends and I visited my big brother from my fraternity ove the summer in Minneapolis. Ironically enough, I'll be working there this summer!</p>

      <p>My girlfriend and I took a trip to Cancun for Spring Break this year. It was phenomenal!</p>
