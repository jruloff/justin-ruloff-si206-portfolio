	<p id="contactMe">If you would like to be updated on events that happen in my amazingly entertaining life (lol), please shoot me an e-mail and I will add you to my list-serve! (not really). Other than this, I would like to sincerely thank you for visiting my portfolio. In case you were interested, here are some random facts about me. I was a state champion bowler. I'm obsessed with Harry Potter. My favorite soccer team is PSG, because Zlatan Ibrahimovic is the man. I enjoy tailgating. I love country music - Kenny Chesney is one of my favorite people on the planet. I know every word to Step Brothers. I really, really like Italian food (my whole family is Italian....Salut!). I have never been pulled over. I love Siberian Huskies and Black Labs.</p>
	<p>Alright, now I'm done talking. Thank you once again for visiting my site. Hopefully it was at least slightly entertaining for you! ***NOTE: THIS IS NOT A SERIOUS OR PROFESSIONAL PORTFOLIO. THIS WAS DESIGNED TO COMPLETE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SI 206 AND IS NOT A REPRESENTATION OF MY PROFESSIONALISM OR COMPLETE RESUME***.
